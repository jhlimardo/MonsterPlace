MonsterPlace
It is a multiplayer NFT card game web platform. It is based on a game between two players who have cards with attack points and defense points. There are two types of cards: classic and NFT.

In order to play, you must be over 18 years old, register with a valid email and password. You must own at least three cards of either type. To acquire them, the site offers you two types of stores, the classic one, where you can buy them with your credit card or in the NFT store through MetaMask using the cryptocurrency of your choice.

The creation of the letters is done through a control panel to which only the administrator has access; from there you can generate unique non-NFT classic cards and NFT cards linked to them by a contract that guarantees their uniqueness.
